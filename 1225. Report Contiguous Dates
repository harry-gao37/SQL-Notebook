#The main process: union; using ranking and id to get tag and the same tag is continuous;show the result




# Solution 

SELECT DISTINCT tag period_state,
        MIN(success_date) OVER (PARTITION BY rk,tag) start_date,
	MAX(success_date) OVER (PARTITION BY rk,tag) end_date
FROM (
	SELECT *, id+1-ranking rk
	FROM(	
		SELECT *,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY tag ORDER BY success_date) ranking,     
		       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY success_date) id
		FROM(
			SELECT *,'succeeded' AS tag FROM succeeded
			UNION
			SELECT *,'failed' AS tag FROM failed
		ORDER BY success_date
		) t
	) t2
) t3
WHERE YEAR(success_date) = 2019
ORDER BY start_date
