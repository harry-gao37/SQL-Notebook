#Solution 1: Cumulative salary in early N months 

SELECT B.Id as id,B.Month as month,
(SELECT SUM(e2.Salary) FROM Employee e2 WHERE e2.Id = B.Id AND e2.Month <= B.Month AND e2.Month > B.Month-3 ORDER BY e2.Month DESC LIMIT 3
) as Salary 
FROM (
    SELECT e1.Id,e1.Month,e1.Salary  FROM Employee e1 ,
    (SELECT e.Id , MAX(e.Month) AS Month FROM Employee e GROUP BY e.Id ) A
WHERE
    e1.Id = A.Id  AND e1.Month < A.Month
ORDER BY  e1.Id ASC,e1.Month DESC
 ) B 

#Solution 2 

select Id, AccMonth as Month, sum(Salary) as Salary
from
(
    select a.Id as Id, a.Month as AccMonth, b.Month as Month, b.Salary as Salary
    from 
    (
        select Employee.Id as Id, Employee.Month as Month
        from Employee, (select Id, max(Month) as Month
            from Employee
            group by Id) as LastMonth
            where Employee.Id = LastMonth.Id and Employee.Month != LastMonth.Month) as a 
    join Employee as b
    on a.Id = b.Id and a.Month - b.Month <= 2 and a.Month - b.Month >= 0
) as acc
group by Id, AccMonth
order by Id, Month desc

#Solution 3
SELECT Id, Month,
        SUM(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Id ORDER BY Month ROWS 2 PRECEDING) Salary
FROM Employee 
    WHERE (id, Month) NOT IN (SELECT id, MAX(Month) Month
                        FROM Employee
                        GROUP BY Id)

ORDER BY Id ASC, Month DESC
