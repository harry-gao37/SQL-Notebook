#The cumulative frequency of the median must be greater than or equal to half of the total number.# 
The cumulative frequency of the previous number (less than the median) of the median must be less than or equal to half of the total number.#


#Solution 1 

select
avg(Number) median
from (
    select
        Number,
        Frequency,
        @sum pre_sum,
        @sum := Frequency + @sum curr_sum
    from 
        Numbers,
        (select @sum := 0) t
    order by Number
) t1 
where 
    t1.pre_sum <= (@sum / 2) and 
    t1.curr_sum >= (@sum / 2)

#Solution 2

select avg(number) as median
from
(select number, sum(frequency) over(order by number asc) as asc_amount, 
                sum(frequency) over(order by number desc) as desc_amount,
                sum(frequency) over() as total_num
from numbers) a
where asc_amount >= total_num/2 and desc_amount >= total_num / 2
