#Solution 1 

select b.id,b.company,b.salary

from (
    select id,company,salary,
    case @com when company then @rk:=@rk+1 else @rk:=1 end rk,
    @com:=company

left join 
    (
    select company,count(1)/2 cnt from employee group by company) c
on b.company=c.company
where b.rk in (cnt+0.5,cnt+1,cnt);


#Solution 2

SELECT Id, Company, Salary
FROM Employee
WHERE Id in (
    SELECT e1.Id
    FROM Employee e1
    JOIN Employee e2
    ON e1.Company = e2.Company
    GROUP BY e1.Id
    HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN e1.Salary >= e2.Salary THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= COUNT(*)/2 
    AND SUM(CASE WHEN e1.Salary <= e2.Salary THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= COUNT(*)/2
    )
GROUP BY Company, Salary
ORDER BY Company

#Solution 3

select Id,Company,Salary from 
(
select Id,Company,Salary,
row_number() over(partition by Company order by Salary) as rnk,
count(Salary) over(partition by Company) as cnt from Employee 
) t 
where rnk in (cnt/2,cnt/2+1,cnt/2+0.5)
