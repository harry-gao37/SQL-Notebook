# Solution 1

select
    c1.visited_on,sum(c2.amount) as amount,
    round(sum(c2.amount)/7,2) as average_amount 
    from (select distinct(visited_on) from Customer)c1 join Customer c2 
    on datediff(c1.visited_on,c2.visited_on)>=0 
        and datediff(c1.visited_on,c2.visited_on)<=6
    group by c1.visited_on
    having count(distinct c2.visited_on)>=7
    order by c1.visited_on
    
    
    
    

# Solution 2

select distinct visited_on,sum_amount as amount,round(average_amount,2) as average_amount 
from
(
    select visited_on,
        sum(amount) over(order by visited_on rows 6 preceding) as sum_amount,

         group by visited_on
         )t1
)t2 
where datediff(visited_on,(select min(visited_on)from Customer))>=6





# Solution 3


select visited_on,amount,average_amount from 
(
select visited_on,
row_number() over (order by visited_on) rnum,
sum(amount) over (order by visited_on rows 6 preceding) amount,
round(avg(amount) over (order by visited_on rows 6 preceding),2) average_amount 
from
